## Creating a Repo
1) Create a repo, initialize with README and choose license (MIT or GNU).
2) After you clone down the repo, create a .gitignore
3) Go to https://github.com/github/gitignore, grap the Node gitignore, and go into the Global directory and find the file for your operating system and your text editor.
